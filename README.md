## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the key parts of the project:

1. **Components**:
   - `Layout.tsx` / `MobileLayout.tsx`: Responsively handle layouts for desktop and mobile views with features like navigation menus and user profiles.
   - `GoogleMap.tsx`: Fully interactive Google Maps component for live ride tracking and markers.
   - `PlacesAutocomplete.tsx`: Google Places integration for searching locations.
   - `ProtectedRoute.tsx`: Protects certain routes and ensures access is allowed only for authenticated users.
   
2. **API Layer**:
   - **`api.ts`**:
     - Defines reusable DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for handling common API requests and responses.
     - Emphasizes type safety for user info, rides, trips, and vehicles.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - **`.env.example`**:
     - Configurable keys for the Google Maps API and backend API base URL.
